### Reading Nancy Armstrong's *Desire and Domestic Fiction*

So last week, we finished reading *Robinson Crusoe* and developed a working understanding of that novel in terms of Ian Watt's claims about the large political and social changes that accompanied the "rise" of the novel. We spent quite a long time talking about what it meant for narrative to focus on an everyday person's life: the ways in which that was new, and the implications of that new possibility.  And we talked about "formal realism," and tried to hack our way through Watt's account of formal realism as a style that is "only a convention," but a convention that makes a claim for having a specially unmediated relation to the reality of everyday life by virtue of it's denotative style that gives the reader "all the particulars." (We talked, too, about the relation between Watt's account of formal realism and particular descriptions we found in the novel - of Friday, for example, and of Crusoe; we considered how earlier descriptive protocols (the blason, the account and the list) are visible in descriptions in *Crusoe*; and we asked if we could connect description to questions of colonization. And of course we talked about many other things that were more or less related: about location in Robinson Crusoe, about the novel's reception and when it becomes possible to interpret RC as a critique of colonialism (as opposed to a text with some particular representations of colonists in it);  about about Joyce and Richetti's claims about Crusoe as colonist etc.)

What we didn't talk much - at all? - about was gender - or even, for that matter, about women. That changed this week. We read (a lot of) Samuel Richardson's *Pamela*, and began to talk about how the middle-class narrative looks when the protagonist is a woman. This week, you have read a selection from Nancy Armstrong's "Introduction: The Politics of Domesticating Culture, Then and Now" from her 1987 book *Desire and Domestic Fiction,* and we want to make sure we have a working account of her argument. In particular, we want to understand how her work revises ideas we've encountered so far about the novel's relation to the modern, middle-class individual.

Armstrong's argument is a little counterintuitive: she argues that "the rise of the domestic woman" is "a major event in political history" (467):

<audio src="Armstrong2.m4a" controls preload></audio>

Armstrong says she is "tracing the history of a specifically modern form of desire that, during the early eighteenth century, changing criteria for determining what was most important in a female." She argues that "In place of the intricate status system that had long dominated British thinking, these authors began to represent an individual's value in terms of his, but more often in terms of her, essential qualities of mind." (467)

So when Armstrong says that "domestic fiction unfolded the operations of human desire as though they were independent of political history"(469), she is arguing that this is a very new way of thinking about human desire, of the factors that go in to the feeling that a person is valuable.

Looking ahead to later novels by Frances Burney (we will read her *Evelina*) and Jane Austen (we will read her *Northanger Abbey*), Armstrong marks a moment when readers came to understand "the ideal woman as an imaginary construct," and the way a woman (or in fact anyone) lives out their individuality has being an always-unsuccessful attempt to measure up to the model of ideal womanhood. This, she points out, is a feature not a bug of the gendered political ideology of middle-class life.

We should think about this in terms of our ongoing discussion we are having about the novel's ongoing problem: how do you represent an everyday, particular person but also make them an example, someone the reader could be or be like? Or, how do you represent an everyday, unimportant, particular person in a widely-circulated print medium that (if successful) guarantees that the representation of a person as a kind of exemplary status?  If Pamela is in danger of seeming too much like a model and not enough like a particular individual, this becomes a problem solved by later novelists.

Armstrong also notes that in writing this book she is looking backwards from her moment - the mid-1980s - to see the ideal (almost "fictional") model of the domestic woman that she encounters in her everyday life as getting its start in eighteenth-century novels like Pamela; as she writes,

> I am convinced that the household Richardson envisioned for Pamela has grown more powerful during the time that has passed between his day and ours. (472)

Do we - in a different historical moment and as different people - still see that idea of the household held up as a model? If so, how and where? If not what has changed?

We should also take a minute to think about a core aspects of Armstrong's method: the fluidity with which she imagines the relation between fiction and social behavior, and - related - her use of both literary and non-literary texts:

Given this, can we be more specific about what Armstrong means when she says that literature worked to "produce" a "new woman"? How might *Pamela* have been read in this way? How does fiction produce social forms and norms that don't yet exist?

In the survey on your reading of *Desire and Domestic Fiction* I asked you each to select a single sentence from the excerpt you read seems to best capture Armstrong's argument; you came up with some very good candidates:

> This struggle to represent sexuality took the form of a struggle to individuate wherever there was a collective body, to attach psychological motives to what had been the openly political behavior of contending groups, and to evaluate these according to a set of moral norms that exalted the domestic woman over and above her aristocratic counterpart.

> And by representing life with such a woman as not only desirable but also available to virtually anyone, this ideal eventually reached out beyond the beliefs of region, faction, and religious sect to unify the interests of those groups who were neither extremely powerful nor very poor.

> As the individual came to be known in this way [the "way" meaning being determined by psychological "depths" rather than class, politics, regional background, etc.], a modern form of power, which could not be distinguished from such knowledge, took over.

> In this way, domestic fiction could represent an alternative form of political power without appearing to contest the distribution of power that it represented as historically given. (471)

> My point is that language, which once represented the history of the individual as well as the history of the state in terms of kinship relations, was dismantled to form the masculine and feminine spheres that characterize modern culture.

> My point is that language, which once represented the history of the individual as well as the history of the state in terms of kinship relations, was dismantled to form the masculine and feminine spheres that characterize modern culture (Armstrong 469).

> Most fiction, which represented identity in terms or region, sect, or faction, could not very well affirm the universality of any particular form of desire. In contrast, domestic fiction unfolded the operations of human desire as if they were independent of political history.

> Fielding's uncouth heroes may generate a sense of political innocence by virtue of the gap between their education and the one their urbane author clearly possesses, but the explicitly female narrators of Pamela, Evelina, or The Mysteries of Udolpho are more effective in launching a political critique because their gender identifies them as having no claim to political power" (Armstrong 471).

> It is only by thus subordinating all social differences to those based on gender that these novels bring order to social relationships.

> ...domestic fiction actively sought to disentangle the language of sexual relations from the language of politics and, in so doing, to introduce a new for of political power.

> Fielding's uncouth heroes may generate a sense of political innocence by virtue of the gap between their education and their urbane author clearly possesses, but the explicitly female narrators of Pamela, Evelina, or The Mysteries of Udolpho are more effective in launching a political critique because their gender identifies them as having no claim to political power.

> As the individual came to be known in this way, a modern form of power, which could not be distinguished from such knowledge, took over.

> Domestic fiction mapped out a new domain of discourse as it invested common forms of social behavior with the emotional values of women

> I am suggesting that over time the novel produced a language of increasing psychological complexity for understanding individual behavior.

> Female writing was not only responsible for the gendering of discourse; it was also responsible for representing sexual relations as something entirely removed from politics.

> The novel, together with all manner of printed material, helped to redefine what men were supposed to desire in women and what women, in turn, were supposed to desire to be (473).

> It is my contention that narratives which seemed to be concerned solely with matters of courtship and marriage in fact seized authority to say what was female, and that they did so in order to contest the reigning notion of kinship relations that attached most power and privilege to certain family lines (468).

> It insists that the history of the novel cannot be understood apart from the history of sexuality.

> I am saying the female was the figure, above all else, on whom depended the outcome of the struggle among competing ideologies" (468).
